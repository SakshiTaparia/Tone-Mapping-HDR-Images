# Tone Mapping HDR Images

Real-world scenes often have a very large dynamic range (the ratio of brightest to darkest intensities) which can span several orders of magnitude. Such high dynamic range (HDR) images cannot be reproduced directly on conventional displays. 

For a more naturalistic appearance, the range of intensities has to be compressed to the low dynamic range of the display, while approximately maintaining the appearance of the image. This process is known as tone mapping or dynamic range compression.
